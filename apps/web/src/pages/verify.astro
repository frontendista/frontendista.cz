		<h1>Verification</h1>
		<p>
			On this page, you can verify the uniqueness of your generated message card.
			The card is signed using the ECDSA asymmetric encryption algorithm.
			Ensure that the card has not been altered; otherwise, the verification will fail.
		</p>
		<p>
			To verify the card, drag and drop the card file into the designated area below, or click the "SELECT SVG" button to choose the file.
			Click "VERIFY" button to verify the card.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that the card is not sent anywhere; the verification process is completed locally within your browser.

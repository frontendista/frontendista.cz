			<Heading class="mb-lg" href="#summary">Collaboration summary</Heading>
			<p>I'm currently searching for a new opportunity in the development industry.</p>
			<p>Below are details concerning the type of collaboration I'm looking for.</p>
			<p>Check out my <Link kind="text" href="/documents/pavel-sušický-résumé.pdf" target="_blank" externalIcon>résumé</Link> and projects to see whether I'm a good fit for the opportunity.</p>

		<section id="roles" class="flex flex-col gap-lg">
			<Heading as="h2" href="#roles" class="mb-lg">Roles and seniority</Heading>
			<p>I'm mainly focused on frontend development (since frontendista.cz, lol). However, I'm open to other related positions if applicable.</p>
			<p>I consider myself a junior since I also account for "human or soft skills" aspects of the job. Technically, I hope my <Link kind="text" href="https://github.com/susickypavel">GitHub</Link> and <Link kind="text" href="/documents/pavel-sušický-résumé.pdf" target="_blank" externalIcon>résumé</Link> speak for themselves.</p>

			<Heading as="h2" href="#capacity" class="mb-lg">Working capacity</Heading>
			<p>I'm studying at the Czech Technical University in Prague, so I have limited available capacity.</p>
			<p>However, I'm very keen to work as much as possible during the semester, but I need flexibility when important mid-term and finals are coming.</p>
			<p>I'd expect to work 20 hours per week with flexibility during important school-related things.</p>

		<section id="environment" class="flex flex-col items-start gap-lg">
			<Heading as="h2" href="#environment" class="mb-lg">Working environment (onsite / hybrid / remote)</Heading>
			<p>Ideally, I would like to work hybrid so that I can get help from others and also be able to work remotely to save time and cost.</p>
			<p>I'm not against fully remote collaboration, but I'd prefer hybrid opportunities, at least for a few weeks, to "have the feeling" of the team I'm working with.</p>
			<p>I'm based in Prague, Czech Republic for onsite / hybrid collaborations.</p>

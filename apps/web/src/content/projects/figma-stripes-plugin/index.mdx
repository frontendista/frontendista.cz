## Purpose

Back in 2021, I had a use case where I needed to add striped backgrounds to my Figma design. To my surprise, this feature is not available in Figma by default. Here we are with a plugin that can generate striped backgrounds with different color combinations, rotations and scales. It's a very bare-bone implementation and could be improved in many ways.

## Technologies

- React
- TypeScript
- Figma plugin API
